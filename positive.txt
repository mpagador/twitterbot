Always try your best!
Follow your passions!
Today is what you make of it!
Get out there and chase your dreams!
It's never too late to start!
Spread love and kindness wherever you go!
I hope you all have a good day today!
Never let a bad situation bring out the worst in you.
It doesn’t matter how slowly you go, as long as you don't stop.
Whenever you find yourself doubting how far you can go, just remember how far you have come.
There’s something in you that the world needs.
A little progress everyday adds up to big results!
Believe in yourself and you’ll be unstoppable.
Look for something positive in each day, even if some days you have to look a little harder.
Stop beating yourself up! You are a work in progress, which means you get there a little at a time, not all at once.
Take a deep breath. It’s just a bad day, not a bad life.
