Always try your best!
Follow your passions!
Today is what you make of it!
Get out there and chase your dreams!
It's never too late to start!
Spread love and kindness wherever you go!
I hope you all have a good day today!
Never let a bad situation bring out the worst in you.
It doesn’t matter how slowly you go, as long as you don't stop.
Whenever you find yourself doubting how far you can go, just remember how far you have come.
There’s something in you that the world needs.
A little progress everyday adds up to big results!
Believe in yourself and you’ll be unstoppable.
Look for something positive in each day, even if some days you have to look a little harder.
Stop beating yourself up! You are a work in progress, which means you get there a little at a time, not all at once.
Take a deep breath. It’s just a bad day, not a bad life.
Fight for your dreams, never let anyone break you down by saying that you can‘t do something.
If you don’t see any light, it just means that it’s somewhere ahead and you’ll reach it very soon. Just keep going!
The best is yet to come!
Just take it one day at a time.
Keep on going!
Don't give up on yourself!
Bad days are like rainy days. They come and eventually go, and after that sunny days come.
Keep up the good work. I am rooting for you.
The only time you run out of chances is when you stop taking them.
I hope you live a life you are proud of. And if you find that you are not, I hope you have the strength to start over!
I wish you the strength to face the challenges of life with confidence and the wisdom to choose your battles carefully!
If you're looking for a good sign, this is it.
Make today an amazing day!
It’s okay to make mistakes, that’s how we learn.
Never let the things you want make you forget the things you have!
We are not given a good or bad life! We are just given a life and it’s up to us to make it good or bad!
It’s your road and yours alone! Others may walk it with you, but no one can walk it for you!
Your mindset is everything.
You didn't come this far to only come this far.
You're always one decision away from a totally different life.
Listen to your gut. It knows what is best for you.
Think only of the best, work only for the best, and expect only the best. You deserve nothing less.
Always do your best so you can be proud that you gave it your best shot.
Don’t be afraid to go out on a limb... that’s where the fruit is!
Make your dreams happen!
Life shrinks or expands in proportion with one’s courage.
Mistakes are proof that you are trying.
Your value doesn't decrease based on someone's inability to see your worth.
Be strong, you never know who you are inspiring
It might be stormy now, but it can't rain forever.
Even the mighty oak starts as a small acorn.
You are the architect of your life; You build its foundation and choose its contents.
Shoot for the moon! If you fall, you'll land among the stars... and stars are really pretty.
Do the thing that you've been meaning to do!
