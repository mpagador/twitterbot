# @marissasbot
A bot that tweets positive messages, encouragements, and compliments to its followers using the tweepy library. It randomly decides between tweeting a positive or inspiring quote, and tweeting an encouragement or compliment to a randomly chosen follower. A log is used to track which followers have already received messages that day, and is reset at midnight.
