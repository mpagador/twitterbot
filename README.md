# [@marissasbot](https://twitter.com/marissasbot "Twitter Page for @marissasbot")
A bot that tweets positive messages, encouragements, and compliments to its followers using the [tweepy](http://docs.tweepy.org/en/v3.5.0/ "Tweepy Documentation") library. It randomly decides between tweeting a positive or inspiring quote, and tweeting an encouragement or compliment to a randomly chosen follower. A log is used to track which followers have already received messages that day, and is reset at midnight.
