# [@marissasbot](https://twitter.com/marissasbot "Twitter Page for @marissasbot")
A bot that tweets positive messages, encouragements, and compliments to its followers using the [tweepy](http://docs.tweepy.org/en/v3.5.0/ "Tweepy Documentation") library. It randomly decides between tweeting a positive or inspiring quote, and tweeting an encouragement or compliment to a randomly chosen follower. A log is used to track which followers have already received messages, and is reset once every follower has gotten at least one. The same process is used for tracking each type of message and making sure each one is used at least once before the respective log is reset.
